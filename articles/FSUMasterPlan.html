                        <p style="font-style: italic;">
                            "All aboard for undead destruction! Crush hordes of zombies and unravel eldritch mysteries, all from the cab of your rune-powered steam engine.

                        <h2>Keep the BGA good bits</h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Characters and story:</b> We took the story darker and more brutal than bigger studios could risk and it really connected. Use an easy to understand but original base story, then go really deep and unique for players who love lore.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>The unexpected:</b> Do you go from office to sex dungeon to chapel within 1 minute? Does the chapel organ suddenly grow limbs? Keep'em guessing and engaged with story and gameplay twists.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Quick to and constant fun:</b> VR is a faff, remove as many barriers as possible, get players in quick and get to the fun bit. Boot to in game should be immediate. Have no loading screens to keep immersion. Even if a player is jumping in for 10 minutes, that 0:05 of loading and menus, 9:55 of fun.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Frantic and embodied action:</b> VR is best when you're so engaged you forget it's a game. Weapons and interactions should feel like second nature and combat should be tuned so you are only ever a moment from death, using skill to just keep your head above water.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Improve the BGA bad bits</h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Add variable difficulty:</b> BGA was brutally hard, keep the hardness there for the punishment gluttons, but add settings to cater to everyone's skill levels.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Long tutorial:</b> Players should be shooting zombie heads off within 1 minute of first starting the app. No boring preamble, quick set up, then let them loose.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Unclear trailer:</b> I absolutely love the BGA trailer, shooting a live action trailer was amazing and it was my love letter to Terminator 2! BUT, lots of players couldn't discern what the game was about. Make sure this time the messaging is still interesting, but actually clear as to what the gameplay is.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>More playtesting before release:</b> Some of the aforementioned bad bits could have been ironed out with more playtesting, . Keep the build playable and available at all times.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Add a layer of innovation</h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Steam Engine!</b> The innovation here is smooth player momentum control between moving platforms that feels great and doesn't cause motion sickness. Driving the Rune Train feels incredible, I find myself just driving around Necropolis island mowing down zombies.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Open World!</b> Tricky on Quest but doable. Skyrim style; whatever the player can see they can go to. Large areas of open train track with more condensed areas for on foot exploration, all with no loading screens and consistent performance and visual quality.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Multiplatform from the start:</b> BGA was built for Quest then later improved for Steam (still not finished, watch this space). This time build multiplatform from the get go to speed up cross platform shipping.
                        </p>
                            
                        <h2>Sell it better</h2>
                        <p>
                            <b>Ship to Steam sooner:</b> ship to Steam while there is still buzz around the release. This may not be day 1 simultaneous release but should be quicker this time.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Build more publicly:</b> I think it's probably better this time to bring the players along for the messy journey with all the rough edges than pretend it's a AAA product.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>Understand price:</b> Unfortunately $16.99 was too much for BGA at release. Get more data and talk to as many studios as possible. Look at what's working now and be willing to try something radically different. VR is in a bit of a crappy freemium hellscape at the moment, but I still hope/believe a quality premium game can shine through to a reasonable audience.
